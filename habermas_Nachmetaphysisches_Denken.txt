Self-Q: What do you feel most terrible about your nation(maybe from some degree of nationalism perspective)
Self-A: Things make me hopeless is that most(nearly all) people in this country (excluding rulers) do not have real value, do not have mind, do not face history and bring it alive to temporary life, no matter if he is Æ½Ãñ or well-known enterpreneur, man with little knowledge or man with huge knowledge(e.g. reporter). Everyone of this kind seems sure that he/she know what is best for all, what is worst for all. Ironic is that while each one feel he/she has this firm and independent moral criteria of the action/choice of the society, he/she often speaks out the same thing about this if you ask him/her to talk about it. The most often talked view is like "we can never do xxx" ""xxx is the worst" "we can never be too xxx" and such argument often conflict with most basic theory or the most shallow emperical observations.
